# TypeScript LangChain Business Search

Description: This repository contains a TypeScript project that utilizes the LangChain library in conjunction with the SERPAPI (Search Engine Results Page API) to perform business searches on Google. The project aims to simplify the process of searching for businesses and retrieving essential information such as company names, phone numbers, and locations. The result is returned in a structured JSON format, making it convenient for developers to integrate this functionality into their applications.
